## Overview

**Calculate the Fibinachi Numbers**:

**Project Description**:

I created a basic Typescript project to recursivly calculate the fibinachi number.
This project was to help me learn the basics of setting up a Typescript project, and
basic Typescript programming.

**Project Goals**:

The goal of this project is to calculate the fibinachi numbers in an easy way for the user
to use.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. First download the repository
2. Then download the Liveserver extention in vscode
3. Then click of the go live button to view the project in your browser!

Instructions for using the software:

1. Use the input element to select how many of the fibinachi numbers you want to calculate
2. Then click of the Calculate!
3.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- The "ide" I use is VSCodium
- The only dependancy we'll need is typescript so type npm i typescript --save-dev
- Then the type npx tsc to compile any changes from index.ts to index.js

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] Make it so you can calculate more numbers
- [ ] Improve the front-end so it looks better
- [ ] Make it so the user can calculate other sequences of numbers
